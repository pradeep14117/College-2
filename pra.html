         A "through ball" is a strategic move used across various sports to exploit gaps 
	in the opposing team's formation and create scoring or attacking opportunities. In volleyball, it involves 
	setting or placing the ball through gaps in the defense to enable a spike. In cricket, it refers
        to hitting the ball through gaps in the field for runs. In football (soccer), itâ€™s a precisely weighted pass that goes between or past
 	defenders for an attacker to chase and attempt a goal. 
	This concept emphasizes accuracy, vision, and timing to outsmart opponents and gain an advantage
